# Collision layers

Layers for physics are called Collision layers.

You can use a collision layer matrix (Edit > Project Settings > Physics 2D) to determine which layers will colide.

## Example

If we have a setup like this:

The collision matrix should look like this:

Note that `RedCollision` and `BlueCollison` are two custom layers added by us.
